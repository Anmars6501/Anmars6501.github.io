Aaliyah's Portfolio

This project serves as an opening stage website for me as a coder. It shows the begining of my journey and it. 
At the moment of this repo, I am taking a 24 week course with MIT xPro to become a fullstack developer with the MERN stack.
So, I can say this repo serves as the begining of what will be a long journey.
As the time goes, I hope you find my work interesting and sufficient.

Thank you - Aaliyah.
